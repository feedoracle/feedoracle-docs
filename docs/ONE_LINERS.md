# Regulatory Memory Layer — Key Messages

## Primary Tagline
> "You can't retroactively establish verifiable data history — unless it was preserved when it happened."

## Alternative Taglines
- "From data feed to data evidence."
- "What was known, when it was known — provably."
- "Historical data states, cryptographically verified."
- "Attestation-grade infrastructure for regulatory disclosure."

## Positioning Statements

### For Regulators
> "Verifiable historical data states for examination and audit."

### For Auditors
> "No reconstruction needed — retrieve attested snapshots from any point in time."

### For Legal Teams
> "Attestation-grade data provenance for dispute support."

### For DAOs
> "Prove the data behind every governance decision."

### For Institutions
> "Demonstrate due diligence with contemporaneous data records."

## Differentiation Statement
> "Unlike traditional data feeds that answer 'What is the current state?', Regulatory Memory Layer answers 'What was reported at time X, and can you prove it?'"

## Moat Statement
> "Competitors cannot recreate past data states. This is a time-moat, not a feature-moat."
