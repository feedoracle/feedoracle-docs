# Regulatory Memory Layer
## Evidence-Grade Data Infrastructure for Historical Verification

---

**Regulatory Memory Layer** is an extension of FeedOracle that preserves verifiable, point-in-time data states.

Instead of answering *"What is the current value?"*, it enables institutions to prove:

> *"What data was reported at a specific moment — and under which methodology."*

Each snapshot is cryptographically hashed, timestamped, and anchored on-chain, creating a non-repudiable historical record.

This allows regulators, auditors, legal teams, and DAOs to independently verify what was known at the time of a filing, vote, or transaction — without relying on reconstructed data.

### Key Principle

> **"You can't retroactively establish verifiable data history — unless it was preserved when it happened."**

---

### What It Does

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Point-in-Time Capture** | Periodic snapshots of all data states |
| **Cryptographic Anchoring** | Hash + timestamp on Polygon/Ethereum |
| **Verifiable Retrieval** | Query any historical state with proof |
| **Non-Repudiation** | Neither party can deny what was reported |

---

### What It Is NOT

Regulatory Memory Layer does not certify compliance or data accuracy. 

It provides **attestation-grade data provenance**: proof of what FeedOracle reported and when.

---

### Use Cases

- **Audit Facilitation** — Prove what data informed a regulatory filing
- **DAO Governance** — Verify the data state behind a vote
- **Dispute Documentation** — Establish what was known at transaction time
- **Cross-Border Compliance** — Single verifiable record for multiple jurisdictions
